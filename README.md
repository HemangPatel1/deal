##Pinch
###A 'Snapchat meets Groupon' Makers Academy Final Project

####Concept
*Follow the brands you like.*<br>
*Love the deals you get.*

Pinch is the new way for businesses to connect with fans of their brand.

Companies post special offers to their followers, each with a 30-120s time limit which indicates how long each person has to decide whether they're going to purchase the offer or not. If time runs out and a purchase hasn't yet been made, the deal is gone forever!

####Features
*Customer features* <br>

* Account creation, with profile avatar
* Set business category preferences
* Follow/unfollow from a list of participating business
* View offer preview cards posted by businesses
* View an offer, complete with countdown timer
* When the timer runs out, the user is redirected back to the offer page
